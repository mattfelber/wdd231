  <h1>The Key Tenets of Stoicism</h1>
  <p>Stoicism isn't a rigid set of rules, but rather a framework for living a virtuous and meaningful life. It's built on several core principles that offer guidance for navigating life's complexities.</p>
  <h2>Living with Virtue as Your Guide</h2>
  <p>At the heart of Stoicism lies the concept of virtue ethics. Stoics believe that cultivating virtues like wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance is essential for living a good life. These virtues act as guiding principles, helping us make sound decisions and navigate challenges with integrity.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Wisdom (Phronesis):</b> The ability to use reason and good judgment to discern the right course of action in any situation.</li>
    <li><b>Courage (Andreia):</b> The strength to face adversity with bravery and perseverance, not in the absence of fear, but in spite of it.</li>
    <li><b>Justice (Dikaiosynē):</b> Acting fairly and treating others with respect, upholding what is right and just.</li>
    <li><b>Temperance (Sophrosynē):</b> Moderation and self-control in all aspects of life, avoiding extremes and finding a healthy balance.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By focusing on developing these virtues, Stoicism encourages us to live with purpose and integrity, contributing positively to the world around us.</p>
