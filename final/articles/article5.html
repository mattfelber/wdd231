  <h1>Applying Stoicism in Daily Life</h1>
  <p>Stoicism isn't just a theoretical philosophy; it's a practical guide for living a more meaningful and fulfilling life. Here are some ways you can integrate Stoic principles into your daily routine:</p>
  <h2>The Morning Meditation</h2>
  <p>Start your day with a short meditation practice. Reflect on your core values and what you want to achieve that day. This sets a mindful tone and helps you approach challenges with a Stoic perspective.</p>
  <h2>Practice Gratitude</h2>
  <p>Stoics emphasize appreciating what you have. Take some time each day to reflect on the things you're grateful for, big or small. This cultivates a sense of contentment and reduces feelings of envy or lack.</p>
  <h2>Focus on What You Can Control</h2>
  <p>Throughout the day, identify situations where you might feel frustrated or overwhelmed. Ask yourself: "What can I control in this situation?" By focusing on your actions and reactions, you regain a sense of agency and avoid wasting energy on things outside your control.</p>
  <h2>Memento Mori (Remember You Must Die)</h2>
  <p>This famous Stoic practice may seem morbid at first glance, but it's actually a reminder to live each day to the fullest. By acknowledging our mortality, we prioritize what truly matters and avoid getting caught up in trivialities.</p>
  <p>Remember, Stoicism is a journey, not a destination. By incorporating these practices into your daily life, you can gradually cultivate a more resilient, mindful, and virtuous way of living.</p>
