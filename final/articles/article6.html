  <h1>Famous Stoic Figures: Embodying Philosophy in Action</h1>
  <p>Stoicism wasn't just abstract ideas; it was a philosophy practiced by influential figures who grappled with real-world challenges. By exploring the lives and teachings of some prominent Stoics, we gain a deeper understanding of how these principles translated into action.</p>

  <h2>Zeno of Citium: The Founding Father</h2>
  <p>Zeno of Citium (334 - 262 BC), a Phoenician merchant who settled in Athens, is considered the founder of Stoicism. He established a school where he taught the importance of living in accordance with nature (physis) and using reason as our guide. Zeno emphasized living a virtuous life, characterized by wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance.</p>


  <h2>Epictetus: The Ex-Slave with Enduring Wisdom</h2>
  <p>Epictetus (c. 55 - 135 AD) was a Roman Stoic philosopher born into slavery. Despite his circumstances, he embodied the principles of Stoicism. He emphasized self-discipline and accepting what is beyond our control. His teachings, preserved in his student's writings, continue to inspire people today, reminding us that true freedom lies in mastering our thoughts and reactions.</p>


  <h2>Seneca: The Statesman and Philosopher</h2>
  <p>Lucius Annaeus Seneca (4 BC - 65 AD) was a prominent Roman statesman, playwright, and philosopher. Despite his wealth and power, he actively practiced Stoicism. Seneca wrote extensively on ethics and living a meaningful life. His letters offer practical advice on topics like dealing with adversity, cultivating virtue, and finding inner peace.</p>

  <h2>Marcus Aurelius: The Stoic Emperor</h2>
  <p>Marcus Aurelius (121 - 180 AD) was a Roman emperor who ruled during a time of great turmoil. Despite the pressures of leadership, he found solace in Stoicism. His personal writings, known as "Meditations," offer profound reflections on living virtuously, facing death with courage, and fulfilling one's duties.</p>
